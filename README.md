# Stock-Analysis
Module 2 VBA
VBA Challenge Project

Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to refactor the solution code in Module 2 to optimize the script and enable the scrip run more efficiently. The previous solution script had many layers to it, the refactored code is more consolidated and more versatile in its usage. This Analysis will help Steve analyze thousands of stocks in a short time. 

Results
The refactored all stock analysis “2017” code ran for 0.1220703 seconds as opposed to 18821.39 seconds “allstockanalysis” macro. Refactoring shortened the run time of the macro. Refactoring the code by using arrays improved the readability of the code and has less steps than the solution code provided in the module.


Summary
I learnt a lot refactoring the code. The advantage of refactoring is that there were shorter and seemed condensed as opposed to a long broken-down step by step process in the original solution code. The code also ran for a shorter time which would have been more noticeable if the Excel data was a lot more.

As a new programmer, I found the long step by step easier because it helped me understand the reason why I had to write some codes. This code was a starting point for me and as I was refactoring the code, the “allstockanalysis” script was a reference point for me
